From the very beginning, the game sets up a tough atmosphere of loneliness. The main action takes place in Shoshone National Forest of Wyoming in 1989 (a reference to Yellowstone fires of 1988). According to the storyline, right after the appointment to the fire tower in Shoshone forest Henry starts facing strange things. The further gameplay is based on exploring the entire forest and investigating its phenomena. Players’ progress will affect the accessibility of the distant game areas. Sometimes the silence is being interrupted by the protagonist's walkie-talkie, which connects him with his supervisor Delilah. Gameplay also includes mechanics of choice within the dialogue: each optional phrase reflects on Henry’s relations with Dalilah. In addition to the puzzles of the forest, Henry tries to solve his own experiences while wandering. Playing for Henry and his accomplice gamers will have to clear up the mysteries of the past, connected with the fire tower in Shoshone National Forest.\"),\n (993,\n  'PlayWay S.A., Duality Games',\n  'Casual, Indie, Simulation',\n  'Try it now for free!',\n  None,\n  'singleplayer',\n  1,\n  'English, French, Italian, German, Polish, Russian, Turkish, Korean, Portuguese, Hungarian',\n  'https://store.steampowered.com/app/991170/?snr=1_5_9__205',\n  1,\n  0,\n  'GTX 660Ti / R9 270X',\n  '21 GB available space',\n  '6 GB RAM',\n  'Simulation, Casual, Indie, Trading, Singleplayer, Exploration, Economy, Horror, Management, Realistic, First-Person, Sandbox, Physics, Funny, Adventure, Inventory Management, Atmospheric, Education, Relaxing, Family Friendly',\n  'Barn Finders',\n  285666,\n  None,\n  500,\n  'PC',\n  'exceptional: 2, recommended: 1',\n  '2020-06-16',\n  None,\n  31,\n  0,\n  \"Search for valuables stashed in abandoned barns ranging from old clocks, musical instruments, antiques, gold, weaponry or even vintage cars and motorcycles and sell them with profit.Take part in storage auctionsTake part in storage auctions, bid high and buy yourself a chance to find exclusive items hidden in the past.Investigate special locations.Discover new places and learn their history.

You find yourself stranded on the Talos I space station, invaded by hostile aliens referred to as the Typhon. To survive, you must explore Talos I in search of weapons and resources to fight off the invaders. Along the way, you'll use neural modification devices to learn skills and psychic abilites.\\nPrey's gameplay loop takes heavy inspiration from System Shock and Bioshock. The game received critical acclaim for its gameplay and its atmosphere.
